PHP Backend Exploration Project: Expense Tracking Application

This project represents a thorough investigation into the possibilities of PHP backend development, centering around the creation of an expense tracking application. While the codebase is designed for developmental purposes exclusively and not intended for commercial use, it serves as a robust framework for comprehending diverse PHP concepts.

Overcoming challenges was an integral part of the development process, as this project intentionally forgoes established frameworks in favor of a custom-built, yet efficient, framework tailored to its specific requirements.

In addition to mastering PHP fundamentals such as variables, conditional statements, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and strings, this endeavor delves into advanced features introduced in PHP 8. Noteworthy aspects include the application of arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators, variadic arguments, nullish coalescing operator, and more.

This exploration extends beyond basic concepts to encompass object-oriented programming principles, covering essential elements like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Furthermore, the codebase incorporates prevalent design patterns such as MVC, singleton pattern, factory pattern, dependency injection, and adheres to PSR concepts.

Significantly, the project integrates the use of a relational database, employing secure practices such as form validation and password hashing. Leveraging Composer and Packagist as key tools underscores a commitment to modern development practices and effective code management. This comprehensive exploration not only serves as a valuable learning experience but also establishes a solid foundation for understanding PHP's capabilities in backend development, complete with secure data handling practices.
